Use ./naan_rec to generate ARK NAANs.

Use ./mint_doip to generate DOI prefixes.

DOI prefixes are generated from a store of prefixes given to us by
DataCite and loaded into the noid minting "queue" so that they come
out upon a mint request.  There's a minter for CDL prefixes that is
reloaded with ../forge_doip/loadit and a minter for Purdue prefixes
that is reloaded with ../forge_doip_purdue/loadit.
