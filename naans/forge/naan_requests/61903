Subject: Re: Interested ingenerating ARKs

Hello Tom,

Thanks for your message.  The NAAN,

	61903

has been registered for Family Search and you may begin using it
immediately.

Regarding defining and extending the ARK specification, this is an
opportune time.  I'm the author of the spec and would be very interested
to hear your questions and concerns.  We don't consider the spec "cooked"
in all respects, but at the same time we've received requests to prepare
it for ISO standardization.  My organization is also considering rolling
out some new identifiers services.  All in all, your timing is good, and
I'd be happy to schedule a phone call with you.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/61903/xt...." for
one "sub-publisher" in an organization.  Opaque prefixes that only have
meaning to information professionals are often a good idea and have
precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

-John
