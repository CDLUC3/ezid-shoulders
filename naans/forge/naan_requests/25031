Hi John,

Thanks for your message.  The NAAN,

	25031

has been registered for the University of Kanxas and you may begin
using it immediately.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/25031/xt...." for one
"sub-publisher" in the Library.  Opaque prefixes that only have meaning
to information professionals are often a good idea and have precedent in
schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

-John
