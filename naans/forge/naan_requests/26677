Hi Hayward,

Thanks for your message.  The NAAN,

	26677

has been registered for the Library and Archives Canada/Bibliothèque et
Archives Canada and you may begin using it immediately.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/26677/xt...." for
one "sub-publisher" in an organization.  Opaque prefixes that only have
meaning to information professionals are often a good idea and have
precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

Regarding your Tomcat question, I've been asking around but don't yet
have an answer.  I figure it must be possible, but I'll get back to you
when I find out more.  One fallback might be to run Apache in front of
Tomcat (we do that in reverse-proxy mode for load balancing), though
it shouldn't require such an extreme measure.  Let's both keep looking
and get back to each other?

-John
