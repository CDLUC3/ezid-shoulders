Hi Evan,

You came to the right place. ;-)   The five-digit NAAN (they're all
either five or nine digits) now reserved for you is,

	27927

But which organization will be making the name assignment policy
decisions?  Would that be Ithaka?  (JSTOR?  E-Archive?)

Yes, that looks pretty reasonable, but you'll want to drop the 3rd '/' in

	ark:/1234/dmid/1234567890abcdef 

which is reserved in ARKs to permit the recipient to make the strong
assumption that the above object has a structural "is part of" relationship
to the object

	ark:/1234/dmid

It would probably be better to use something like

	ark:/27927/dmid_1234567890abcdef 
or
	ark:/27927/dmid1234567890abcdef 

Thanks for bringing up the Documentum-generated ids, which I didn't know
about.  Do you know if they're doing anything to avoid accidental semantics,
or if they have check characters?   I'm asking this from my experience with
developing the principles found in the "noid" software, such as a reduced
alphanumeric character set (0123456789bcdfghjkmnpqrstvwxz -- no vowels, no
"ell"), encouraging the placement of a digit between each pair of alphas,
and being able to validate whether a received identifier contains common
transcription errors.
