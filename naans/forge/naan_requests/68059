Hi Daniele,

Thanks for writing.  Usually I or one of my colleagues responds to
these requests, sent to support-cdl-l@listserv.ucop.edu .

There's no form, although we plan to automate these requests, in which
case there will be a very short form.  Basically, we ask that you be from
a plausible institution (such as CNES), and that you give us contact
information for a person there (such as yourself).

Assuming that you're still interested, the NAAN,

 	68059

has been registered for CNES (Centre National d'Ã‰tudes Spatiales) and
you may begin using it immediately.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/68059/xt...." for
one "sub-publisher" in an organization.  Opaque prefixes that only have
meaning to information professionals are often a good idea and have
precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

-John
