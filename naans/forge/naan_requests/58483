Subject: Re: Interested in generating ARKs

Dear Mr de Solan,

Thanks for your message.  The NAAN,

	58483

has been registered for the Archives départementales de la Somme
and you may begin using it immediately.  There are few rules to follow,
but we recommend the use of the "noid" software for generating unique
opaque strings; a new version of noid is in preparation that should be
easier to install and to use if you're able to wait until January.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/58483/xt...." for
one "sub-publisher" in an organization.  Opaque prefixes that only have
meaning to information professionals are often a good idea and have
precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

-John
