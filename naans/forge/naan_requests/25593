Hi Kyle,

Thanks for your message.  First, the NAAN,

	25593

has been registered for Emory University and you may begin using it
immediately.  Second, I'd recommend that instead of using the NMAH
"id.library.emory.edu" for your identifiers, you use

	id.emory.edu

in keeping with your role as _the_ cultural memory organization for the
univerisity.  Either one is fine (no architechtural conflict) for the plan
to keep options open regarding resolution of diverse kinds of identifiers.

Right now, DNS-assisted resolution isn't really an issue (users don't
want to install browser plugins).  For now, we follow the Handle/DOI/URN
tradition of proxying (but with ARK you always know what the core identity
is) through a stable, reasonably short hostname, eg,

	http://id.emory.edu/ark:/25593/fb123456789

The NMAH's are registered at CDL (mirrored with NLM), but they're not
accessed for real-time resolution.  Does this answer your question?

In thinking about how to manage the ARK namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/25593/xt...." for one
"sub-publisher" in the Library.  Opaque prefixes that only have meaning
to information professionals are often a good idea and have precedent in
schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to be able to craft a small number of standardized statements for
name assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.
