Hi Marsha,

Thanks for your request for an ARK Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN).
The NAAN,

        78428

has been registered for the University of Washington, and you may begin
using it immediately.  In thinking about how to manage the namespace,
you may find it helpful to consider the usual practice of partitioning it
with reserved prefixes of, say 1-5 characters, eg, using "xt" to get names
of the form "ark:/78428/xt...." for one "sub-publisher" in the Library.
Opaque prefixes that only have meaning to information professionals are
often a good idea and have precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  We would also ask you
to think about articulating your assignment policy in a form that we
can eventually link to from the NAAN registry.  You will find an
example policy on the page  http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/ark/ .

-John
