Hi Delphine,

Thanks for your message and so sorry for the delay in responding.  Your
message was routed to me precisely at the moment that I came down with a
bad case of sciatica, so it got stuck in a crack (until I found it in my
old email after figuring out how to type while still flat on my back).
Anyway, the NAAN,

 	29413

has been registered for the the University of Pennsylvania and you may
begin using it immediately.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/29413/xt...." for
one "sub-publisher" in an organization.  Opaque prefixes that only have
meaning to information professionals are often a good idea and have
precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

-John
