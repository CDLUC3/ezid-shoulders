Hi Kevin,

I'm afraid I may have sent you an incorrect NAAN.
What I have recorded for Princeton is

	88435

If that's not what I sent you, please accept my apologies and
hope that you haven't published any ARKs with the wrong NAAN.

Hi Kevin,

Thanks for your request for an ARK Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN).
The NAAN,

	64269

has been registered for the Princeton University Library, and you may
begin using it immediately.  In thinking about how to manage the namespace,
you may find it helpful to consider the usual practice of partitioning it
with reserved prefixes of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form
"ark:/64269/xt...." for one "sub-publisher" in the Library.  Opaque
prefixes that only have meaning to information professionals are often
a good idea and have precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you noticed, there are
placeholders for most NAA policies; we're hoping to be able to craft a
small number of standardized statements that organizations can use if they
want to.

One question I have is in regards to the parameters

> diglib.princeton.edu NJP

from your email.  What we're looking for here is a domain name plus a
shorter reference abbreviation for the organization.  What I'd suggest is

	princeton.edu PUL

which aligns well with the concept of assigning the NAAN to the
institution of Princeton University, to be managed by the Library.
Would that work for you?
