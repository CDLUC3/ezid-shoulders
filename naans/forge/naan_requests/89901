Dear Mr Saternus,

Thank you for your request for an ARK Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN).
The NAAN,

	89901

has been registered for the Archives of the Region of Västra Götaland and
the City of Gothenburg, Sweden, and you may begin using it immediately.
In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/89901/xt...." for one
"sub-publisher" in the Library.  Opaque prefixes that only have meaning
to information professionals are often a good idea and have precedent in
schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you noticed, there are
placeholders for most NAA policies; we're hoping to be able to craft a
small number of standardized statements that organizations can use if they
want to.

-John
