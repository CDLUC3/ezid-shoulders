Subject: Re: Interested in generating ARKS

Hi John,

Yes, I would like to have an NAAN assigned to Simon Fraser University. The Library is already involved in several digital curation activities such as a consortial Private LOCKSS Network, and we're starting to develop a formal digital curation program.

We will start to mint noids for internal use and will be implementing public ARKS when our curation plan is sufficiently mature to define preservation service levels.

Thank you,

Mark
