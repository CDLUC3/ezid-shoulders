Hi Dave,

Thanks for your message.  The NAAN,

 	81055

has been registered for the British Library and you may begin
using it immediately.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/81055/xt...." for
one "sub-publisher" in an organization.  Opaque prefixes that only have
meaning to information professionals are often a good idea and have
precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

-John

PS.  I see via Facebook that Markus noticed some broken links due to the
slightly rough launch today of CDL's newly redesigned website.  Many of
the redirects we'd set up (eg, to the ARK material) came undone and are
currently being repaired!
