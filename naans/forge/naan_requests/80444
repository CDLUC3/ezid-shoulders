Hi Al,

Thanks again for the informative call today.  The NAAN,

	80444

has been registered for the Northwest Digital Archives and you may begin
using it immediately.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/80444/xt...." for one
"sub-publisher" in the Library.  Opaque prefixes that only have meaning
to information professionals are often a good idea and have precedent in
schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you know, we're hoping
to be able to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

Also, I've attached the script we use at CDL to respond to ARKs submitted
with '?' marks at the end.

-John
