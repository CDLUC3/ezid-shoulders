Yes, there is.  I've just assigned the name assigning authority number,

	13960

to the Internet Archive.

In case you're interested, the CDL will shortly be releasing the software
on CPAN that we use for minting and maintaining identifiers (ARKs,
confirmation numbers for transactions with our preservation repository).
I've attached the documentation if you'd like an early look at it.

I understand that IA has its own crawl-time-plus-source-URL identifiers
for crawled web material.  If that's different or if you're anticipating
any changes, I'd be fascinated in hearing about it.

Thanks for your interest,

-John
