Hi Adam,

Thanks for your message.  The NAAN,

	78319

has been registered for Google and you may begin using it immediately.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/78319/xt...." for one
"sub-publisher" in an organization.  Opaque prefixes that only have meaning
to information professionals are often a good idea and have precedent in
schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.  I think I mentioned some of this on my
recent visit with you, but hope I'm not repeating myself too much.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

-John
