Hi David,

Back from my travels, I saw about your request for an ARK name assigning
authority number.  The NAAN number

	64269

has been reserved for the Digital Curation Centre.

If you're coming to the San Francisco area in October, we'd be delighted
to meet with you here in Oakland and learn more about the DCC's plans.
It was a real pleasure to meet you, and I look forward to more exchanges
in the future.

-John
