identifier_plans: At BenchFly, we provide a platform for researchers to record and share their technical knowledge with the scientific community. We plan on assigning these technical videos identifiers so that as researchers share their content around the web, there will be a solid identifier in place that points to the original source file. This will also allow them to use the DOIs to get credit for the work they’ve done in emerging “altmetrics” systems. We already have the infrastructure in place to accommodate all of the DOI requirements, so issuing the DOI number will be an easy addition to our platform.
comments: I've written him to ask about the internal/local identifiers. Haven't heard back yet. I'll update the  Pivotal ticket when I do.
