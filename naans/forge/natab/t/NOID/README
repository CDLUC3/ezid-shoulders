# Creation record for the identifier generator in NOID/noid.bdb.

who:       jak/users
what:      10 sequential identifiers of form .sd
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind
       and mint 10 identifiers with the template ".sd".
       Sample identifiers would be "00001/4" and "00001/0".
       Minting order is sequential.
when:      20060710172854
where:     dot:/home/jak/wr/ark/natab/t/.
Version:   Noid 0.423
Size:      10
Template:  .sd
       A suggested parent directory for this template is "noid_1".  Note:
       separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
       short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
       "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
Policy:    (:G-ANI-E)
       This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRANITE")
         "G-ANI-E", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
