% noid dbcreate .rddddd long 00001 n2t.info naan
Created:   minter for 100000 random identifiers of form .rddddd
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind
       and mint 100,000 identifiers with the template ".rddddd".
       Sample identifiers would be "00001/79953" and "00001/22939".
       Minting order is random.  See ./NOID/README for details.

% noid hold set `sed 's/:.*//' grandfathered`
# test with
% noid mint 100000


-----
Going forward, mint as usual but prepare to filter out unwanted NAANs.
For example, if for a NANN starting with 0 or containing too many repeated
digits, do

% noid mint 1
id: 00001/01234

% noid hold set 00001/01234

% noid mint 1
...   <repeat as necessary>

Then record the assignment you choose back into "grandfathered" just in
case we have to start over again.
