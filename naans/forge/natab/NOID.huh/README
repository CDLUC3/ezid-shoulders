# Creation record for the identifier generator in NOID/noid.bdb.

who:       jak/users
what:      100000 random identifiers of form .rddddd
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind
       and mint 100,000 identifiers with the template ".rddddd".
       Sample identifiers would be "00001/99661" and "00001/80680".
       Minting order is random.
when:      20060820133919
where:     dot:/home/jak/wr/ark/natab/.
Version:   Noid 0.423
Size:      100000
Template:  .rddddd
       A suggested parent directory for this template is "noid_5".  Note:
       separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
       short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
       "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
Policy:    (:GRANI-E)
       This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRANITE")
         "GRANI-E", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
