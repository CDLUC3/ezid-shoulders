# Creation record for the identifier generator in NOID/noid.bdb.

erc:
who:       jak/noid
what:      100000 random identifiers of form .rddddd
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind
       and mint 100,000 identifiers with the template ".rddddd".
       Sample identifiers would be "54064" and "46770".
       Minting order is random.
when:      20100823115039
where:     aretha.ucop.edu:/noid/naans/forge/.
Version:   Noid 0.424
Size:      100000
Template:  .rddddd
       A suggested parent directory for this template is "noid_5".  Note:
       separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
       short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
       "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
Policy:    (:-RA-I-E)
       This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRANITE")
         "-RA-I-E", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
