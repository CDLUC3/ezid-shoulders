Hi XXX,

Thanks for your message.  The NAAN,

	19495

has been registered for the Ohio Supercomputer Center and you may begin
using it immediately.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/19495/xt3...." for
each "sub-publisher" in an organization.  Opaque prefixes that only have
meaning to information professionals are often a good idea and have
precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

The ARK specification linked from [1] is currently the best guide for how
to create URLs that comply with ARK rules, although it is fairly technical.
There is a public discussion group for ARKs (Archival Resource Keys) at

         http://groups.google.com/group/arks-forum

intended for people interested in sharing with and learning from others
about how ARKs have been or could be used in identifier applications.
There is also a service called EZID (http://n2t.net/ezid) that you may
wish to use to manage your namespace, which includes minting and resolving
ARKs, DOIs, and other identifiers, as well as maintaining metadata.
Please contact joan.starr@ucop.edu if you are interested in EZID.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

-John
