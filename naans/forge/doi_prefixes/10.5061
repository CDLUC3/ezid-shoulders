Subject: Re: update on DataCite DOIs for Dryad?

Todd,

We've recorded the DOI prefix

 	10.5061

for Dryad's use, and for all practical purposes that will be for Dryad's
exclusive use (a rare exception might be if Dryad ceased to operate,
but it's workflows were taken on by another organization).

To keep things easier to manage, I imagine you may want to partition the
namespace below that with additional prefixes as you assign individual
DOIs.  I'd be quite interested to keep up with your assigning strategy if
you have time to share it.

Attached are two files.  The first is the document that Trisha sent you
regarding the DataCite DOI infrastructure.  The second is a certificate
you'll need to operate one of the interfaces.  I've not yet used them
directly, but would be happy to run interference.

I don't have an answer yet on ORCID, but Trisha may learn something when
she attends the DataCite meeting in a few days.

-John
