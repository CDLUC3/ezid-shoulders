Subject: UC3/CDL and Dryad in DataCite

Sorry, Jan -- one last tweak as we get going with our very first
prefix assignments.

We'd like to start with these two prefixes:

     10.5060		# California Digital Library
     10.5061		# Dryad

The first one we'll need for our own internal use (and it's similar
to another number we use).

-John

Ours, but still unassigned:

10.5064
10.5065
10.5066

Thanks John -- it turns out I will see Todd tomorrow so if there is anything else that I should share with him let me know.

If it wouldn't be too much to ask, would you mind setting aside the block
of ten prefixes,

10.5060		# Dryad
10.5061
10.5062
10.5063
10.5064
10.5065
10.5066
10.5067
10.5068
10.5069

for us to get started?  We'd assign the first one to Dryad and wouldn't
have to bother you again until the 10th next center asked for a prefix. ;-)

Also, it would be very valuable to be able to count on prefixes having
a consistent format.  Do you think we might expect the next 200 prefixes
to be of the form, 10.NNNN ("10." followed by four digits)?

Very much agreed.

Thanks a bunch,
