# Creation record for the identifier generator in NOID/noid.bdb.

erc:
who:       jak/noid
what:      unlimited sequential identifiers of form .zd
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind
       any identifier and mint an unbounded number of identifiers
       with the template ".zd".
       Sample identifiers would be "1" and "62199".
       Minting order is sequential.
when:      20120229154714
where:     elektra.ucop.edu:/noid/naans/forge_doip/.
Version:   Noid 0.424
Size:      unlimited
Template:  .zd
       A suggested parent directory for this template is "noidany".  Note:
       separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
       short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
       "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
Policy:    (:------E)
       This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRANITE")
         "------E", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
