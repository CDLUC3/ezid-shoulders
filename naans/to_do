I gave some thought to this, starting with all the different sectors of
the economy, but found that there's a daunting classification problem
and not a clear payoff in terms of what it reveals about one's faith in
the institution.  Pulling back to just GV and ED was a simplification I
also tried, but then that's almost always apparent from the institution's
name.  I think there may be a payoff down the line to a GV or ED
classification, especially for describing NMAs.  For the "to do" list.

I think this is another good one to put on the "to do" list.  I don't
myself have the bandwidth to think this all through yet.
