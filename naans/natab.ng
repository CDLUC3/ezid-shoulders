#
#          Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN) Registry
#
# Each record in this registry file specifies a Name Assigning Authority
# (NAA) and a unique NAA Number (NAAN) that is permanently associated with
# it for the purposes of name (identifier) assignment.  An NAA is an
# organization that assigns names.  If each NAA begins its names with its
# own NAAN, assignments of one NAA will never conflict with those of
# another NAA.  The records in this file conform to the ANVL format.
#
# Each record also specifies an organization-level resolution target for
# N2T (Name-to-Thing), a scheme-agnostic identifier resolver.  The present
# form of the registry descends from the ARK (Archival Resource Key) NAAN
# registry, but can work with a number of different schemes, including ARK,
# URL, DOI, Handle, and URN.  
#
# Terminology is based on the metaphor of a key (or name or identifier),
# locksmithing jargon, and the concept of a branded plastic key-cover.

# |..........................|.......................|....
#    Name Mapping Authority       Base identifier      ...
#
#       NMA = Identifier service provider; as a branded and replaceable
#             add-on, this "cover" helps make a key actionable
#
#    Scheme = Identifier type, which tells how the NAAN is delimited
#
#      NAAN = Opaque name for the organization that created the identifier;
#             a key's "bow" (NAAN) is immutable, but not its cover (NMA)
#
#  Shoulder = Fixed pattern extending the Bow to the Blade; NAA determines
#             how the pattern is delimited, which permits it to partition
#             its namespace opaquely into sub-namespaces and to delegate
#             name assignment; example Shoulder above ends with first digit
#
#     Blade = Variable pattern extending the Shoulder to the Tip
#
#       Tip = Final character of Base identifier, critical for computation
#             of a check character; for ARKs, Base ends before the next '/'
#
#   Base id = Identifier for an object (thing) at its coarsest level of
#             granularity and without identifier extensions; defined for
#             all ARKs but for other identifiers depends on local practice
#
# Extension = Pattern appended to Base to name parts of an object and
#             variants thereof; may be assigned by the NAA or not; may be
#             invented and publicized by an NMA; generally unstructured,
#             but ARKs reserve '/' and '.' to disclose structure; example:
#
#                  ark:/13030/tqb3kh97gh8z/chap3/fig5.jpg
#                 |.......................|..............|
#                      Base identifier       Extension
#
# Opacity
#
# Many of these terms serve semantic opacity, which is useful in creating
# base identifiers that age and travel well.  Opacity is often balanced by
# the addtion of hints in replaceable appendages to the base, such as NMA
# branding before it and extensions that suggest current service offerings.
#
# Resolution
#
# An NMA is the starting place for internet resolution.  ARKs, URLs, and
# PURLs use manifest, scheme-agnostic redirecting HTTP servers as NMAs.
# The DOI, Handle, and URN schemes each uses an implicit, scheme-specific
# NMA with its own protocol.  Resolution in all these cases relies on a
# final HTTP access.
#
# N2T Resolver
#
# The N2T resolver is an NMA that takes an incoming identifier that has a
# NAAN and looks it up in this registry.  If there is an identifier
# service provider (another NMA) corresponding to the NAAN, the identifier
# is redirected to it.  Thus N2T provides global resolution for ARKs in a
# way that is functionally equivalent to DOI, Handle, and URN resolution.
# N2T is capable of providing registry-based redirection for any scheme.
#
# Kinds of Namespaces
#
# Resolution involves namespaces of different kinds.  These definitions
# use the term "pool" to mean all possible names within some constraint.
#
#   Schemespace = pool of identifier schemes (ark, doi, hdl, urn, etc.)
#      Bowspace = pool of NAANs under a given scheme (eg, ark:/13030)
# Shoulderspace = pool of Shoulders under a given Bowspace
#    Bladespace = pool of identifiers assigned under a given Shoulder
#                 (eg, ark:/13030/xh4...)
#
# These terms are also used, but often more loosely.
#
#     Namespace = pool of identifiers sharing a given NAAN
# Sub-namespace = pool of identifiers sharing a given NAAN and Shoulder
#
# NAA Record Template
#
# Each record has the form below.  Template items in [square brackets]
# are optional and items in <angle brackets> are to be replacd with values
# that apply to the NAA being described.  Most items should be evident
# from the short label in <brackets>, with a "*" indicating that a longer
# explanation appears later.  Dates are in TEMPER format "YYYY.MM.DD" or
# "YYYY", with a "-" indicating a period (eg, tenure in a certain role)
# that may be closed or open-ended (eg, 2003-2005, 2007-).
#! Lines beginning '#!' or '!' will be suppressed from public view.
#
# Some ANVL features used may not be self-evident.  The "(=)" string is
# used to separate alternative forms (variants) of one value or sub-value.
# The "|" character separates sub-values that contribute different types
# of information to the overall value.  The ";" character separates
# multiple "peer" sub-values (of the same type).  When a value or
# sub-value is required but missing, the string "(:unkn)" can be used as
# a coded value meaning "unknown".
#
#  naa:
#  who:   <official organization name>
#         [ (=) <if different, organization name in english> ] (=) acronym

#     NR = No re-assignment.  Once a base identifier-to-object association
#          has been made public, that association shall remain unique into
#          the indefinite future.
#     OP = Opacity.  Base identifiers shall be assigned with no widely
#          recognizable semantic information.
#     CC = A check character is generated in assigned identifiers to guard
#          against common transcription errors.
#
#  * NAA Tenure
#    The NAA for a given NAAN, while expected to be long-lived, might one
#    day cease to exist or to assign names, in which case its tenure in
#    the role of name assigner is indicated.
#
#! * Contact Tenure
#!   Similarly, the tenure of a person in role of contact for the NAA may
#!   change.  Multiple contact elements, past and present, may be listed.

Hi Ulrike,

Thanks for your message.  The NAAN,

	10261

has been registered for the Jewish Museum Berlin and you may begin
using it immediately.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/10261/xt...." for
one "sub-publisher" in an organization.  Opaque prefixes that only have
meaning to information professionals are often a good idea and have
precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

There's nothing else you need to do right now.  As you may know, we're
hoping to craft a small number of standardized statements for name
assigning authority policy that organizations can use if they want to.

-John

Hi Mingyu,

Thanks for your message.  There's no license required to use ARKs,
and no particular technical support costs other than what would be
normal overhead for maintaining URLs on your website.  If you would
like to use ARKs (which your message seemed to suggest), the NAAN,

	84475

has been registered for the University of Houston and you may begin
using it immediately.

In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful
to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes
of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/84475/xt...." for
