identifiers: DOIs and ARKs
identifier_plans: We plan to assign DOIs to online datasets associated with specific research projects. These projects are associated in turn with two print publication series, which refer extensively to the related online datasets and thus require persistent unique identifiers for them. We have already begun discussions with the UTA library about the use of ARK IDs as identifiers for individual records and items within those datasets, rather than DOIs, and we would like to continue this discussion over the coming year.
