Procedure for adding, modifying, and installing shoulders.  Passwords can
be found at <https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/UC3/EZID+Operations>.

--------------------
1. Edit master_shoulders.txt in this directory.

2. Validate the file.

   ./validate-shoulders master_shoulders.txt

3. If a new DataCite datacenter is required, create it and assign it
the necessary prefix(es).  Use the PURDUE allocator password and PURDUE.*
( $(wegnpw purdueadmin) ) instead of CDL.* if appropriate.

   ./mdsadmin $(wegnpw cdladmin) create CDL.BUL 'Brown University Library' \
      10.1234 10.5678 ...

4. Operationally test any newly-added or modified shoulders by listing
them on the command line.  Note that testing a DOI shoulder requires
the password of the shoulder's DataCite allocator, which can be given
with the -d {ALLOCATOR_PASSWORD} option.

 ./validate-shoulders master_shoulders.txt -m ezid:$(wegnpw ezid) ark:/12345/foo

 ./validate-shoulders master_shoulders.txt -m ezid:$(wegnpw ezid) -d $(wegnpw cdladmin) doi:10.1234/BAR

5. Install new shoulder file.  This will place the previously-installed
shoulder file in master_shoulders.txt.bak in this directory.

   ./install-shoulders

6. Reload all EZID instances to make them aware of the change.

   ./reload-all $(wegnpw ezidadmin)

===========
For all other matters, login to mds.datacite.org as either "cdl" or "purdue".
