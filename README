// Procedure for adding, modifying, and installing shoulders.
   Updated 2020.01.06 (jak)

These procedures work only for mainstream cases of shoulders with minters.
For example, supershoulders are not mainstream, and are created by hand.

1. Edit master_shoulders.txt in this directory by following these steps.

 a. Copy form data to a file named, eg, 'request'.
 b. Run "./form2shoulder request", which creates a minter if called for,
    generates a new shoulder entry, stores it in file 'new_shoulder',
    and appends the request file contents to request_log.
 c. Edit 'master_shoulders.txt', find first shoulder, and above it
    insert the contents of 'new_shoulder'.

2. Validate the file syntax, and (only if valid) then operationally test by
   minting (burning up) one id per shoulder listed shoulder.  This is normally
   done for newly-added or modified shoulders. Example:

   ./valsh ark:/12345/f5 doi:10.1234/G6

   If you only want to validate the file syntax, run "./valsh -".

3. Install new shoulder file. This will place the previously-installed
   shoulder file in master_shoulders.txt.bak in this directory.

   ./install-shoulders

4. Reload all EZID instances to make them aware of the change.

   ./reload-all "$(ezidpw)"
